            <h4 class="gallerytext" style="color:white;"> In Rio Da Yung OG's song lyrics, you are able to see that when he uses the word bitch, it is usually not in the context of literally calling someone a bitch. He uses it almost as a filler word to add more agression to his songs. Shoreline Mafia, (song analysis below this one) uses the term bitch in more of a direct way or targeted more at someone.

            <h4 class="gallerytext" style="color:White;"> Shoreline Mafia has a different approach to how they use the word bitch compared to Rio. Most of shorelines lyrics, when using a word that could have a target, will use it in the targeted context, not as a filler. This also went for the use of the N word in these songs, less agressive with rio, more agressive and targeted with shoreline.
