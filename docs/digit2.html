            <h4>One thing I find more challenging with WordPress would be finding everything I need to get it to look the way I want. I find it very hard to find things in WordPress and keep loading different links and possibly saving/not saving things when navigating so much. I don’t find many challenges with HTML compared to WordPress. HTML allows me to configure it exactly how I want it but WordPress is very limiting. WordPress is more of figure it out yourself by navigating the menus or installing many different plugins to get it customized the way you like. HTML has websites that tell you what every word means and in what context they can be used. It lays out  more of a foundation rather than throwing you into a mess of navigation bars.

            <h4 class="gallerytext" style="color:white;"> In Rio Da Yung OG's song lyrics, you are able to see that when he uses the word bitch, it is usually not in the context of literally calling someone a bitch. He uses it almost as a filler word to add more agression to his songs. Shoreline Mafia, (song analysis below this one) uses the term bitch in more of a direct way or targeted more at someone.

        <section class="gallery" style="background-color:purple;">
            <h4 class="gallerytext" style="color:White;"> Shoreline Mafia has a different approach to how they use the word bitch compared to Rio. Most of shorelines lyrics, when using a word that could have a target, will use it in the targeted context, not as a filler. This also went for the use of the N word in these songs, less agressive with rio, more agressive and targeted with shoreline.
