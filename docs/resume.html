            <h4>I was born and raised in Fairview Pennsylvania and attended highschool at Fairview Highschool. I have played soccer since I have been very young. I played for 3 different soccer teams on different states on the same day before and have had a lot of wins. I started varsity as a freshman and won the District 10 winning goal for our team and we went on to win 3 District wins during my highschool career. I worked as a manager for a locally owned grocery store for 2 years and have recently quit to focus on college until I feel confortable</h4>
