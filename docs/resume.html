            <h4>I was born and raised in Fairview Pennsylvania and attended high school at Fairview Highschool. I have played soccer since I have been very young. I played for 3 different soccer teams in different states on the same day before and have had a lot of wins. I started varsity as a freshman and won the District 10 winning goal for our team and we went on to win 3 District wins during my high school career. I worked as a manager for a locally owned grocery store for 2 years and have recently quit to focus on college until I feel comfortable with it.</h4>

            <h4>One thing I find more challenging with WordPress would be finding everything I need to get it to look the way I want. I find it very hard to find things in WordPress and keep loading different links and possibly saving/not saving things when navigating so much. I donâ€™t find many challenges with HTML compared to WordPress. HTML allows me to configure it exactly how I want it but WordPress is very limiting. WordPress is more of figure it out yourself by navigating the menus or installing many different plugins to get it customized the way you like. HTML has websites that tell you what every word means and in what context they can be used. It lays out  more of a foundation rather than throwing you into a mess of navigation bars.
